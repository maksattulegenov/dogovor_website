# 🚀 Railway Deployment Guide

## Prerequisites
- GitHub account with repository: https://github.com/maksattulegenov/dogovor_website
- Railway account (sign up at https://railway.app)

## Step 1: Push to GitHub

```bash
cd d:\workspace\dogovor_website

# Initialize git (if not already done)
git init

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: Medical consent form website"

# Add remote
git remote add origin https://github.com/maksattulegenov/dogovor_website.git

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

If you get an error about branch name, try:
```bash
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 2: Deploy to Railway

### Option A: Railway CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Railway CLI
npm i -g @railway/cli

# Login
railway login

# Initialize project
railway init

# Deploy
railway up
```

### Option B: Railway Dashboard (Easier)
1. Go to https://railway.app
2. Click **"New Project"**
3. Select **"Deploy from GitHub repo"**
4. Choose **maksattulegenov/dogovor_website**
5. Railway will auto-detect the `Procfile` and deploy
6. Wait for deployment to complete

## Step 3: Update Google Cloud Console

After deployment, you'll get a Railway URL like: `https://your-app.railway.app`

Update your Google Cloud Console:
1. Go to https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials
2. Select your OAuth 2.0 Client ID
3. Add to **Authorized JavaScript origins**:
   - `https://your-app.railway.app`
4. Add to **Authorized redirect URIs**:
   - `https://your-app.railway.app`
5. Click **Save**

## Step 4: Test Your Live Website

1. Visit your Railway URL
2. Fill in the form
3. Save signature - sign in with **promedkaraganda@gmail.com**
4. Submit form - data goes to your n8n webhook

## 🎯 Your Deployed Website Will:
- ✅ Work as a static website
- ✅ Accept form submissions
- ✅ Upload signatures to Google Drive
- ✅ Send data to n8n webhook
- ✅ Be accessible from anywhere

## Troubleshooting

### CORS Errors
If you see CORS errors, add your Railway domain to the Google Cloud Console as described above.

### Environment Variables
Railway automatically sets `PORT` environment variable. The `Procfile` uses it to start the Python server.

### Logs
View logs in Railway dashboard to debug any issues.

## 📝 Files for Railway Deployment
- `Procfile` - Tells Railway how to start the app
- `runtime.txt` - Specifies Python version
- `.gitignore` - Excludes sensitive/unnecessary files

## 🔄 Updating Your Deployment
After making changes:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Your update message"
git push
```

Railway will automatically redeploy! 🚀
